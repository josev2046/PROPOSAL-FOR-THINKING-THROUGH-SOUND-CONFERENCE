### Abstract

This paper proposes the "Save Your Archive: BlackLives" art installation series, a project that demonstrates a technical approach to preserving and providing alternative, experimental access to vulnerable audiovisual archives of Black British and diasporic voices. The initiative directly addresses the critical need for robust digital preservation and innovative archival engagement. This is achieved through the implementation of advanced digitisation techniques for legacy media formats and the integration of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture within a custom Media Asset Management (MAM) system. This methodological framework facilitates enhanced accessibility and nuanced engagement with historically underrepresented narratives.

The series, exemplified by our "Unframed Voices" prototype, showcases a modular exhibition design that bridges analogue audio heritage with contemporary digital technologies. This includes the development of time-based media installations leveraging single-board computers (SBCs) and bespoke API development for dynamic content delivery and secure playback management. These installations create immersive listening experiences through concealed digital media players and high-quality audio outputs, enabling unique public interaction with archival material. The curatorial framework centres on historical care, creative reclamation, and public access, positioning the installations as pedagogical and political interventions that activate overlooked voices in public spaces. This technical and conceptual approach, validated by the completed prototype, allows for the systematic processing of significant collections, such as the "GLR Black London" archive, ensuring these vital historical assets inform contemporary discourse and contribute to long-term cultural memory through novel access pathways. The project highlights the multifaceted role of sound in archival practice, demonstrating its capacity to reveal histories, build identity, and contribute to interdisciplinary research methodologies, even when not the central focus of a given study.
