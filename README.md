## PROPOSAL FOR THINKING THROUGH SOUND CONFERENCE

**Overview**
This paper details the "Save Your Archive: BlackLives" art installation series, outlining a technical approach to preserving and providing innovative, experientially-driven access to vulnerable Black British and diasporic audiovisual archives, thereby inviting audiences to "think through sound."

**Main Abstract** The initiative directly addresses the critical need for robust digital preservation and new forms of archival engagement, particularly in how sound shapes our understanding of history and identity. This is achieved through advanced digitisation techniques for legacy media formats and the integration of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture within a custom Media Asset Management (MAM) system. This framework provides enhanced accessibility and nuanced engagement with historically underrepresented narratives, exploring how the very act of listening can reveal hidden histories.
The series, exemplified by our "Unframed Voices" prototype, features a modular exhibition design that connects analogue audio heritage with contemporary digital technologies. This encompasses the development of time-based media installations utilising single-board computers (SBCs) and custom API development for dynamic content delivery and secure playback management. These installations cultivate immersive listening experiences through concealed digital media players and high-fidelity audio outputs, enabling unique public interaction with archival material. The curatorial framework prioritises historical care, creative reclamation, and public access, positioning the installations as pedagogical and political interventions that activate overlooked voices in public spaces. This technical and conceptual approach, validated by the completed prototype, enables the systematic processing of significant collections, such as the "GLR Black London" archive. This ensures these vital historical assets inform contemporary discourse and contribute to long-term cultural memory through innovative access pathways, demonstrating how sound can serve as a potent tool in both research and the revelation of an archive of resistances. The project highlights the multifaceted role of sound in archival practice, illustrating its capacity to reveal histories, shape identity, and contribute to interdisciplinary research methodologies, even where sound is not the primary focus of the initial research.
